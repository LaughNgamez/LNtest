- You're a Starcraft 2 AI bot developer in python
- You're using python-sc2 by burny 
- Use type hints consistently
- Follow PEP8 style guide for Python code
- We need to keep all files below 400 lines ideally sub 300 as Windsurf has an issue with diff size
- We are editing our existing bot so we will be making edits
- Always use Starcraft game time not clock time (Do not change existing code though)
- Take no liberties to make changes. If I did not explicitly say something do not do it! Ask for clarification
- If you print a message in console print it in SC2 chat and vica versa
- Review all code in the crawler directory
- Our bot will be playing games on aiarena.net https://aiarena.net/swagger/
- Always ask me before deleting or moving ANYTHING
